# Features

## Colorized values
Colorizing values helps a lot with human pattern recognition.
![Colorized values](screenshots/color.png)

### Custom color palettes

Custom color palettes can be saved and loaded, and generated through various means.

## Easy data alignment
Hexerator considers it important to easily align data with shortcut keys. Proper alignment can make a lot of difference
with pattern recognition.

You can see a YouTube video of it in action here:

## Process Memory editing
Built-in support for opening memory of a process and viewing/editing it.
Can be used to cheat in games, or discover how different applications store data in memory.

You need to run hexerator with root/admin privileges to open memory of other processes.

## Multiple source types
Hexerator supports opening both files and streamed sources like standard input or character devices like `/dev/urandom`.


## Bookmarks

Quickly and easily save and access points of interest in the data.

Additional support for setting a type for a bookmark to display and manipulate the data
associated with it.

## Multiple configurable views

You can have different views into different regions of the same file, with
different column counts and other configurable properties.

## Lua scripting support

You can write Lua scripts to:
- Fill a selection
- Generate a custom color palette
- More coming in the future

## External command support

Support for executing a custom external command on selected data.

You can see a YouTube video of it in action here:

## Diffing

There is basic support for showing differences between
- The current buffer and its source file
- The current buffer and an arbitrary file
- The current metadata and the clean metadata
- Support for more coming in the future

For now diffing is pretty barebones, shown as a list of offsets.
It will be better fleshed out in the future

## Huge file support through memory mapped files

Huge files that couldn't fit in memory can be opened as memory mapped files through a command line
option.
To be implemented.

# Non-features

## Insertion
Insertion would complicate implementation, and for most binary data, including process memory, it will just mess up the data.

## Memory holes support, generic support for huge data
Originally, I wanted to have a generic mechanism for loading only parts of files, but I found that
it would make the implementation way more complex, and possibly inefficient, so I dropped the idea.
Huge files will be eventually supported through memory mapped file support.
