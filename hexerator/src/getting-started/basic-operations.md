# Basic operations

## A-B select

Click somewhere in a view to set the cursor to that location.
You can then press `shift+1` in View mode to set the `A` point of a selection,
and `shift+2` to set the `B` point of a selection.
Once you have both an `A` and a `B` point, the selection is the region spanning
`A` and `B`.

Once you have a selection, you can do various things with it.

- Add a region by right clicking, and selecting `Add region as selection`
- Fill using the fill options in the `Edit` menu
- Run an external command on the selection using `Edit->External command...`
- Unselect with `Esc`

## Select all

You can select everything in a view with `Edit->Select all in view` or `Ctrl+A`.
