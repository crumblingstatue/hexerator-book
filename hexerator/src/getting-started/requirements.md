# Requirements

## Supported platforms

- Windows 7 or newer
- Linux

Looking for a Mac OS developer/maintainer!

## Hardware requirements

- A 32 bit or 64 bit CPU.
  64 bit is highly recommended, because 32 bit can only open files up to 4 GB large.
  Additionally, 32 bit support is not being tested right now.

- A fairly strong GPU that supports OpenGL 2.1+.
  Hexerator renders using the GPU, and it can render a lot of stuff on the screen at once,
  making it fairly GPU intensive.
