# Aligning Data

Once you have opened the save file, you should see something like this.

By default, there are 3 views:

1. A hex view, on the left side
2. A text view in the center
3. A so-called block view on the right. You can think of it like a minimap.

The block view is showing something funky at the top.
It almost looks like some kind of garbled up image.
I wonder if we could look at it from another perspective to better understand what kind of data it is...

We can do that by shifting the number of columns around.
Hold down `ctrl` and the left and right arrow keys to shift the perspective around.
Try messing around until you can make sense of the image.
SPOILER: In this case, the magic number is 80 columns.

That makes a lot more sense!
