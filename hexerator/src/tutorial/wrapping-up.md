# Wrapping up

Hexerator has a lot more features, but currently they are out of the scope of this tutorial.

I hope you'll have fun exploring them on your own!

Expect the documentation of Hexerator to improve in the future.

Contributions to the documentation are welcome at <https://github.com/crumblingstatue/hexerator-book>!
